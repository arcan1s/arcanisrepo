This Connect IQ Developer Agreement (the "Agreement") between you and, if applicable, your company ("you" or "your") and Garmin International, Inc. and its affiliates ("Garmin") governs your use of the SDK and other Program Materials to develop Applications, your submission of Applications for publication on the CIQ Store, and, if applicable, the sale of your Application on the CIQ Store. Capitalized terms have the meanings set forth in the body of this Agreement or in Section IX of this Agreement.

By using the Program Materials, you signify your agreement to this Agreement. Garmin may modify this Agreement at any time by updating this posting. Your continued use of the Program Materials following the posting of a revised Agreement means that you accept and agree to the changes. You should visit this page periodically to review this Agreement. If Garmin makes a material change to the Agreement, we will notify you.

This Agreement supersedes and replaces the Garmin CONNECT IQ SDK License Agreement and CONNECT IQ Application Developer Agreement.
I. Development of Applications using the SDK

    a. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Garmin hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, personal, revocable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to use the Program Materials for the sole purpose of developing and testing Applications. All licenses not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved.
    b. Restrictions: You may not use the Program Materials for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement. You agree not to rent, lease, lend, upload to or host on any website or server, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Program Materials, in whole or in part, or to enable others to do so. You may not and you agree not to, or to enable others to, modify, create derivative works of, copy (except as expressly permitted under this Agreement), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, or decrypt the Program Materials, or any part thereof. You may not: (a) alter or remove any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices appearing on or in the Program Materials; (b) engage in any activity with respect to the Program Materials that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner any Garmin devices, platforms, or systems, or those of any of its affiliates or any third party; or (c) make any statements that you or your Application are affiliated with, or sponsored, certified, or otherwise endorsed by Garmin or any of its affiliates, unless expressly permitted by Garmin in writing.
    c. Updates; No Support or Maintenance: Garmin may, but is not obligated to, extend, enhance, or otherwise modify the SDK at any time without notice. If updates are made available by Garmin, the terms of this Agreement will govern such updates, unless the update is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern. Garmin may, but is not obligated to, provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the SDK. You agree that the form and nature of the Program Materials may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the Program Materials may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the Program Materials.

                (iii) In Garmin’s discretion, Garmin may add applicable sales taxes, VAT taxes, or similar transaction taxes to the final purchase of an Application to an end user.

This Agreement shall commence on the date you indicate your acceptance of the terms and conditions hereof and shall remain in full force and effect until terminated as provided hereunder (the "Term").

        2. Termination for Cause.
